TODO: Move (component related) CSS to components eventually and actually use SCSS there. Styling got a little messed up
TODO: Hover state on disabled btn styling is a little off
TODO: Been using () and =()= and submitHandler=handleSubmit and onSubmit=submitHandler etc. Clean up with consistency

NAV:
TODO: nav anchors are now React NavLinks so some styling needs to be fixed for this
TODO: secnav has buttons, not NavLinks. But I guess they should be, since they are just navlinks but displayed as buttons. Need active states with navlink router and use location props etc.
