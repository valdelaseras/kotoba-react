Styling:
TODO: Move (component related) CSS to components eventually and actually use SCSS there. Styling got a little messed up
TODO: Hover state on disabled btn styling is a little off

Nav:
TODO: in secnav, 'back' is now an actual link to landing/root ( / ). This should actually function as a
 proper back button ( iirc, last time I looked at this the problem was that secnav is outside of <Router>, so I can't use
 history.push or something along those lines )
